Attribute Information:

Each row of the dataset is a single game with the following features (in the order in the vector):
1. Team won the game (1 or -1)
2. Cluster ID (related to location)
3. Game mode (eg All Pick)
4. Game type (eg. Ranked)
5 - end: Each element is an indicator for a hero. Value of 1 indicates that a player from team '1' played as that hero and '-1' for the other team. Hero can be selected by only one player each game. This means that each row has five '1' and five '-1' values.
